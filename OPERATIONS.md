# Ziarem operations — live state

Snapshot of every Ziarem app and integration as of the Hermes install.
This file is the human counterpart to `hermes/skills/ziarem-status/SKILL.md`
(machine-readable status query that returns the same picture).

## Headline

Infrastructure is **configured but largely dormant**. 32 apps registered,
57 credential slots catalogued, but the operational surfaces (Vapi calls,
email blasts, cross-sell automation) aren't producing signal.

| Surface              | State     | Action                                         |
| -------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Marketing senders    | 27 active | Need a live campaign. See `marketing-revive`.  |
| Marketing campaigns  | 1 active, 5 sent, 8 drafted | Activate one or revive cron. |
| AI sales (Vapi)      | 0 calls / 7d | Verify `vault_ai_call_config` + Vapi webhook. |
| Cross-sell pipeline  | 15 stuck at `identified` | See `cross-sell-unstick`. |
| Lead intake          | 22 new (none qualified) | Lead scoring not advancing rows. |
| Telegram             | 3 configs active, 0 msgs / 7d | Bot not connected, or quiet week. |
| Skyvern (Wolf)       | Deployed at `10.1.10.42:8000` | 6 workflows ready; needs job queue rows. |

## Credentials catalog (57 entries)

`hermes/skills/hermes-keys/SKILL.md` is the runtime resolver. The admin
UI reads `public.v_credentials_admin` for status without exposing values.

| Category            | Total | Set | Need filling |
| ------------------- | ----: | --: | -----------: |
| general             |     8 |   2 |            6 |
| messaging_gateway   |     6 |   0 |            6 |
| agent_fleet         |     5 |   0 |            5 |
| email_provider      |     5 |   0 |            5 |
| voice               |     5 |   0 |            5 |
| ai_services         |     5 |   1 |            4 |
| compliance          |     4 |   0 |            4 |
| research            |     4 |   0 |            4 |
| github              |     3 |   0 |            3 |
| infrastructure      |     6 |   4 |            2 |
| mls                 |     3 |   3 |            0 |
| wolf_machine        |     2 |   2 |            0 |
| personal            |     1 |   1 |            0 |

**44 keys** await values from the admin UI. Top 6 highest-leverage to fill:

1. `Google Gemini API` — Hermes default LLM. Without it, no agent reasoning.
2. `OpenAI API (shared by Crawl4AI/Mem0/Pipecat)` — three agents wired to one key.
3. `Vapi - AI Voice Calls` — without it, AI sales floor stays dark.
4. `Telegram Bot - Hermes Gateway` — fastest operator surface to come online.
5. `GitHub PAT - Hermes Skills Hub` — kills the 60 req/hr rate limit on skill installs.
6. `Cloudflare Turnstile - Apply Form` — apply form bot protection (referenced in lead-manager-crm).

## Hermes agent fleet (Wolf Machine LAN)

Already deployed by you on `10.1.10.42`:
- `Skyvern RPA (after deployment)` → port 8000 ✅
- `n8n Wolf Machine (after deployment)` → port 5678 ✅

Pending bring-up:
- Crawl4AI → port 11235
- Mem0 → port 8080
- Pipecat → port 7860
- OpenHands → port 3010

`hermes/agents/install-global.sh` brings the rest up; or run on the same
Wolf Machine box. Compose's port bindings can be moved if those ports
are taken.

## Pre-existing security issue (flagging for your decision)

The `public.credentials` table has two RLS policies that pre-date this work:

| Policy | Roles | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `admins_full_access` | `authenticated` | Any logged-in JWT can `SELECT api_key, api_secret` from every credential. |
| `service_role_all` | PUBLIC | `polroles={-}` is `PUBLIC` — effectively unrestricted. |

**Impact**: anyone with the anon or authenticated JWT can read every key
the stack uses. Not introduced by Hermes but worth fixing before
populating sensitive new keys (Vapi private, GitHub PATs, etc).

**Recommended fix** (review before applying — could break the admin UI's
read path until the UI is moved to `v_credentials_admin`):

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS admins_full_access ON public.credentials;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS service_role_all   ON public.credentials;

CREATE POLICY service_role_all ON public.credentials
  AS PERMISSIVE FOR ALL TO service_role
  USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

GRANT SELECT ON public.v_credentials_admin TO authenticated;
```

Then update the admin UI to read `v_credentials_admin` (presence flags
only) and write via a `SECURITY DEFINER` function so the JWT never
holds direct UPDATE on `credentials`.

## Open issues / parked items

These are real follow-ups that need either (a) a key from you or (b) an
external decision:

1. **Zapier Catch Hook URL** for Arive — referenced by lead-manager-crm
   handoff. Once you wire the Zap, paste URL into `arive_zapier_outbound_url`
   (currently in lead-manager-crm settings.json — not this repo).
2. **Cloudflare Turnstile keys** — the apply form widget is scaffolded
   but needs site/secret keys to activate.
3. **NMLS license number + Florida state license #** — placeholders in
   `licensing.html` (lead-manager-crm).
4. **WhatsApp owner decision** — Hermes gateway OR existing wa-bridge,
   not both. Documented as a hard rule in `hermes/README.md` and
   `agent-fleet` skill.
5. **n8n cross-sell webhook URL** — `N8N_WEBHOOK_ONBOARDING_URL` in
   `.env.example`. Set once your n8n flow is built.
6. **DOWNSTREAM_REPOS variable** — set on this GitHub repo with a
   JSON array of `owner/repo` entries to enable auto-propagation of the
   hermes/ overlay to other repos.
7. **GH_PAT_DOWNSTREAM_DISPATCH secret** — same; PAT with `repo:write`
   on every Ziarem repo.
8. **Rotate `arive_api_key` and `arive_zapier_inbound_secret`** that
   were pasted in plaintext during the lead-manager-crm handoff.

## Quick health-check command

On the VPS, after `bash hermes/agents/install-global.sh`:

```bash
bash hermes/agents/doctor.sh
hermes -z "use ziarem-status to give me a one-paragraph state-of-the-business"
hermes -z "use cross-sell-unstick to list the top 5 stuck opportunities"
hermes -z "use marketing-revive to tell me why no email has gone out in 30 days"
hermes -z "use hermes-keys to list every empty credential by category"
```
